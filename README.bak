# CE-Graph
  Welcome to HUST CE-Graph!
  CE-Graph is high-performance distributed graph-processing framework which is written in C++. It is demonstrated to run much faster than existing distributed graph-processing frameworks, particularly when a high-bandwidth network is available. CE-Graph is build on our communication-efficient computation model, called CE-BSP which eliminates the high communication costs in existing distributed graph-processing frameworks by using the the Block-based Communication Model (BCM). 
How to start with CE-Graph? A demo provided with a word document (Demo.doc) help us to start with CE-Graph.
